# React Weather App

##### What does it do?
On the website is an easter egg styled in CSS. You can change its colors according to your liking.

##### How does the website work?
I used ReactJS to create the site. I also used react-color to get colors from the user.

##### Where did I get the idea for this website?
The beginning of the website is based on tutorial, which is posted on the Youtube platform (channel "Jak zacząć programować?"). I extended the project to take the color from the user and update the easter egg.
